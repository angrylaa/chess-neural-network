# ChessHacks Starter Bot

This is a bot submission for chesshacks! I implemented a neural networking using a policy & value head, trained on a kaggle dataset of magnus carlsen games.

The policy network receives a chess position & predicts which move magnus would play / has played in the past.

The value network receives a chess position & evaluates how good the position is (between -1 to 1).
